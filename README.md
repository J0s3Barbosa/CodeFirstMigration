# Code First approach

technique which helps us to create a database, migrate and maintain the database and its tables from the code. From the code, means that you directly maintain the database and its corresponding tables from the .NET Code. It is helpful when you donâ€™t have a database ready and you want to start working with new fresh project and want to create a database and maintain the database directly from your code.
